    - Create an oracle invoice with details that match the invoice record
    - Convert it to a digital format &#40;i.e. pdf&#41;
    - Upload that invoice file to the invoice record
    - Enter the oracle invoice number on the invoice record
    - You will be prompted to confirm sending the request for payment to the lease/licence holder
