        The following new invoice records have been created for {{ approval.approval_type }} {{ approval.lodgement_number }}:

        {% for invoice in invoices %}
            - {{ invoice.lodgement_number }}
        {% endfor %}

        Before payment can be requested from the lease/licence holder, the following steps must be taken for each invoice record:

        - Create an oracle invoice with details that match the invoice record
        - Convert it to a digital format &#40;i.e. pdf&#41;
        - Upload that invoice file to the invoice record
        - Enter the oracle invoice number on the invoice record
        - You will be prompted to confirm sending the request for payment to the lease/licence holder
